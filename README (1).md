### 🌾 Crop Yield Prediction with Weather Data
An end-to-end data analytics and machine learning project that analyzes historical crop yield data across multiple countries and predicts agricultural productivity by integrating real-time weather information via external APIs.

### 📌 Project Overview
This project aims to bridge the gap between climate science and agriculture. By combining historical yield data with temperature and precipitation patterns, we identify the key environmental drivers of food production.

The project includes a robust data pipeline from SQL storage to Machine Learning forecasting, all presented through an interactive Streamlit interface for data-driven decision-making in agriculture.

## 🛠 Project Workflow

### 1. Data Collection & Storage
Historical Yield Data: Multi-country agricultural records are ingested from local CSV sources.

Weather API Integration: Annual climate data (temperature/rainfall) is fetched via external APIs.

Dockerized SQL Database: All datasets are cleaned and stored in a structured SQL environment to ensure data integrity and reproducibility.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Using Matplotlib and Seaborn, we answer critical business and environmental questions:

Trend Analysis: Which countries have seen the most significant growth in productivity?

Climate Correlation: How do extreme temperature fluctuations impact specific crop types?

Anomaly Detection: Identifying years of drought or unexpected yield drops.

### 3. Machine Learning & Forecasting


### 4. Streamlit Dashboard
The final output is a user-centric application that allows:

Dynamic Filtering: Filter by country, crop type, or year range.

Predictive Sandbox: Input hypothetical weather data to see predicted yield outcomes.

Visual Reports: High-quality charts showing the intersection of climate and farming.
